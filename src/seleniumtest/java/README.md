# test-dir
This directory is intended to be used as the folder on the Eclipse build path containing all the Selenium tests.
The directory structure should look like this:

```
Eclipse-Project
+-- src
|   +-- main
|       +-- java
|           +-- <packages>
|               +-- <Java files>
+-- src
|   +-- seleniumtest
|       +-- java
|           +-- <packages>
|               +-- <Selenium Tests>
+--  README.md
```
